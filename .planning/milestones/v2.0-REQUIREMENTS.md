- **ADV-02**: Theme export to shareable format
- **ADV-03**: AI wallpaper generation on-demand
- **ADV-04**: Color extraction from wallpapers for theme suggestions

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Automatic third-party theme installation | Complexity; discovery + links is sufficient for v2.0 |
| AI wallpaper generation on-demand | Pre-made wallpapers bundled; on-demand adds complexity |
| Dynamic theme generation from wallpapers | pywal/matugen produce inconsistent quality |
| Cloud sync for themes/wallpapers | Local dotfiles + git sync is sufficient |
| Multi-monitor spanning themes | Different colors per monitor adds complexity |
| Real-time theme preview (before apply) | Apply is fast enough; live preview is complex |

**Notes:**
