# Milestone v2.0: Vulcan Appearance Manager - Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-01-30T20:00:00Z
**Status:** TECH DEBT (No blockers, accumulated deferred items)
**Overall Score:** 33/33 requirements satisfied

## Executive Summary

All 33 v2.0 requirements are satisfied. The Vulcan Appearance Manager is complete and functional as a unified theme+wallpaper management application. Human verification (10-08) confirmed all features work end-to-end.

Two architectural features built in Phase 6 (AppState state machine, theme validation) are not fully integrated, representing tech debt rather than missing functionality. Additionally, the wallpaper library has only 3 of 10 themes with wallpapers - the rest have documented sources for manual addition.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with milestone completion. Tech debt can be addressed in v2.1.

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 6: Foundation Architecture

**1. AppState state machine unused**
- **Built:** `state.rs` with Idle/Previewing/Applying transitions
- **Used:** Module declared in main.rs but AppState never imported
- **Impact:** UI components manage state locally (works, but less centralized)
- **Fix effort:** Medium - wire into app.rs and component lifecycle

**2. Security validation bypassed**
- **Built:** `parse_and_validate()` with dangerous pattern detection
- **Used:** `theme_storage.rs` calls `parse_theme_file()` directly
- **Impact:** Theme files not validated for shell injection patterns
- **Fix effort:** Low - replace function calls in theme_storage.rs

### Phase 8: Theme-Wallpaper Binding

**3. CustomOverride detection not automatic**
- **Built:** BindingMode enum with ThemeBound/CustomOverride/Unbound
- **Missing:** No logic to detect when manual wallpaper differs from theme suggestion
- **Impact:** User must manually track binding state
- **Fix effort:** Medium - compare current wallpaper to theme suggestion

### Phase 10: Preset Themes

**4. Wallpaper library incomplete**
- **Built:** 10 theme directories with LICENSE files
- **Downloaded:** 3 wallpapers (Catppuccin Mocha/Latte, Dracula)
- **Missing:** 7 themes have sources documented but no wallpapers
- **Impact:** 7 themes show no wallpaper thumbnail
- **Fix effort:** Low - download from documented sources

## Human Verification Summary

All human verification checkpoints passed:

- **Phase 7 (07-05):** ViewSwitcher tabs, theme browser, wallpaper picker, split dialog
- **Phase 8 (08-06):** Profiles tab, binding dialog, profile save/load/delete
- **Phase 9 (09-04):** All 6 components themed, app self-theming
- **Phase 10 (10-08):** 10 preset themes, discovery section, vulcan-menu integration

## Recommendation

**Proceed with milestone completion.**

All 33 requirements are satisfied. The tech debt items are infrastructure improvements, not missing features:

1. AppState provides cleaner architecture but UI works without it
2. Validation adds security but themes are user-controlled files
3. CustomOverride detection is UX polish, not core functionality
4. Missing wallpapers have documented sources and graceful fallbacks

These can be tracked in v2.1 backlog and addressed as maintenance work.
