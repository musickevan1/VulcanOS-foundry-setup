# Summary: 09-04 Human Verification

## What Was Built

Human verification checkpoint confirming complete theming infrastructure works correctly across all 7 desktop components.

## Outcome

**Status:** VERIFIED ✓

All Phase 9 success criteria confirmed working:

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| waybar | ✓ | Colors update on theme change |
| wofi | ✓ | Launcher matches theme |
| swaync | ✓ | Notification center matches theme |
| hyprlock | ✓ | Lock screen matches theme |
| kitty | ✓ | New terminal windows themed |
| alacritty | ✓ | New terminal windows themed |
| Appearance Manager | ✓ | Self-theming via GTK CSS |

## User Feedback

Enhancement suggestions for future phases:
1. Missing app icon placeholder could use theme accent color (currently orange)
2. Hyprlock could display Vulcan SVG logo in theme-matched colors

These are polish items, not blockers for Phase 9 completion.

## Deliverables

- [x] Human verification of all 7 theming components
