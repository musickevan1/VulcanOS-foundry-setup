<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Complete theming infrastructure with automatic propagation to all desktop components and self-theming GUI.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Setup:**
1. Build the latest app: `cd ~/VulcanOS/vulcan-appearance-manager && cargo build --release`
2. Install: `cp target/release/vulcan-appearance-manager ~/.local/bin/`
3. Launch the app: `vulcan-appearance-manager`

**Test 1: Theme propagation via CLI**
1. Open a terminal: `vulcan-theme set catppuccin-mocha` (or another theme)
2. Verify waybar colors changed (look at the bar)
3. Open wofi (Super+D or similar) - verify colors match theme
4. Open notification panel (swaync) - verify colors match theme
5. Lock screen briefly (if safe) - verify hyprlock shows theme colors

**Test 2: Self-theming**
1. With app open, switch theme: Select a different theme in Themes tab and apply
2. Observe: App's own accent colors should update immediately
3. Check: Suggested-action buttons (like Apply) should use theme accent color
4. Check: Selection highlights should use theme accent color

**Test 3: Terminal theming**
1. Open a NEW kitty window - verify colors match current theme
2. Open a NEW alacritty window - verify colors match current theme
3. Note: Existing terminal windows may not update (expected behavior)

**Test 4: Persistence**
1. Close and reopen the Appearance Manager
2. Verify: App opens with current theme colors applied (not default Vulcan Forge)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "verified" if all 7 components are themed correctly.
If issues found, describe which components failed and what colors were wrong.
  </resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

Human confirms all Phase 9 success criteria:
1. waybar colors update on theme change
2. wofi colors update on theme change
3. swaync colors update on theme change
4. hyprlock colors update on theme change
5. kitty (new windows) uses theme colors
6. alacritty (new windows) uses theme colors
7. Appearance Manager GUI uses current theme colors
</verification>

<success_criteria>
User types "verified" indicating all theming infrastructure works correctly.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/09-theming-infrastructure/09-04-SUMMARY.md`
