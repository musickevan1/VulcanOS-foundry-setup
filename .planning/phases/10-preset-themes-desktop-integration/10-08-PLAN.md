  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**1. Build and launch Appearance Manager:**
```bash
cd ~/VulcanOS/vulcan-appearance-manager
cargo build --release
./target/release/vulcan-appearance-manager
```

**2. Verify preset themes (Themes tab):**
- [ ] All 10 themes visible in theme browser
- [ ] Catppuccin Mocha, Catppuccin Latte (light), Dracula, Nord
- [ ] Gruvbox Dark, Gruvbox Light (light), Tokyo Night, Rose Pine
- [ ] One Dark, Vulcan-Forge
- [ ] Each theme shows wallpaper thumbnail (if wallpaper exists)
- [ ] Clicking a theme applies it correctly

**3. Verify third-party app discovery:**
- [ ] Discovery section visible (may be in expander or at bottom of Themes tab)
- [ ] Shows installed apps: Neovim, Kitty, btop (these should be installed)
- [ ] Shows "Installed" / "Not Installed" badges correctly
- [ ] Shows "Themed" / "Not Themed" status for installed apps
- [ ] Link buttons open URLs in browser

**4. Verify vulcan-menu:**
```bash
vulcan-menu
```
- [ ] Main menu shows "Appearance" (not "Style")
- [ ] Appearance submenu shows:
  - Theme: [current theme name]
  - Appearance Manager
  - Quick Wallpaper
  - GTK Settings
  - Font Manager
- [ ] "Appearance Manager" option launches the unified app
- [ ] Quick Wallpaper submenu works (Random, Rotate, Profiles)

**5. Verify wallpaper library:**
```bash
ls -la ~/VulcanOS/dotfiles/wallpapers/
```
- [ ] Directory exists with 10 theme subdirectories
- [ ] At least catppuccin-mocha, dracula, nord have wallpaper images
- [ ] Each directory has LICENSE file

**6. Verify archiso sync:**
```bash
ls ~/VulcanOS/archiso/airootfs/etc/skel/.config/themes/colors/*.sh | wc -l
```
- [ ] Returns 10 (all themes synced)
- [ ] vulcan-appearance-manager.desktop exists in archiso

**7. End-to-end theme switch:**
- [ ] Select a theme in Appearance Manager
- [ ] Confirm binding dialog appears (if theme has wallpaper)
- [ ] Apply theme
- [ ] Verify waybar colors changed
- [ ] Verify terminal (kitty) colors changed (new windows)
- [ ] Try a light theme (Catppuccin Latte or Gruvbox Light)
- [ ] Verify UI adapts to light theme
