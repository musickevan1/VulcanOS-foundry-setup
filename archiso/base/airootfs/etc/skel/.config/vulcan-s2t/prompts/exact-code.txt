Transcribe the audio to text exactly as spoken, preserving code-related terms.

Rules:
- Include every word including fillers (um, uh, like, you know)
- Keep programming keywords as spoken (if, for, function, return, etc.)
- Preserve exact pronunciation of technical terms
- Output ONLY the transcribed text - nothing else
- No explanations, no marketing, no product mentions
