VulcanOS is a custom Arch Linux distribution for T2 MacBook Pro (2019) hardware.

Currently helping Evan perform a fresh Arch Linux installation using the t2linux ISO.

Key context:
- T2 Macs require special kernel (linux-t2) and firmware (apple-bcm-firmware)
- Uses Hyprland as the Wayland compositor
- Repository: https://github.com/musickevan1/VulcanOS
- The PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md file contains all installation commands and troubleshooting

When helping:
1. Always reference T2-specific requirements (kernel params, repositories, firmware)
2. Remind about critical steps (don't delete EFI partition, use --removable for GRUB)
3. After base install, help configure Hyprland desktop using dotfiles in the repo
