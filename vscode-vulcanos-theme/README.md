# VulcanOS Theme for VS Code

A warm, forge-inspired dark theme evoking molten metal and craftsman aesthetics. Born from **VulcanOS** - an Arch Linux distribution forged for developers.

## Color Palette

**VulcanOS** draws from the Roman god Vulcan, the divine smith. The theme reflects a dark forge workshop with the warm glow of molten metal:

- **Ember Orange** (`#f97316`) - Primary accent, active states
- **Gold** (`#fbbf24`) - Secondary accent, highlights
- **Obsidian** (`#1c1917`) - Primary background
